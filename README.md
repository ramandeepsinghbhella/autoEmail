# Send Auto E-mail
Here we created an app from which we can send e-mail to our subscribers who subscribed particular topic on a particulart time.
I'm using only EXPRESS and mongoDB.

`SMTP_USER`

`SMTP_PASS`

### Documentation

I've not creat any API, we simply run our and code and can send e-mails to our subscribers at particular time.

#### Description
In this project I focused on diet plan. I've have designed total 7 meals in a day. Every meal will be taken after 3 hours which is also benicial for out health. And here I'm directly putting my data in database because we're only dealing with the procedure of sending e-mail on particular topic to the subscriber who subscribed that topic at a particular time.
